# Discussion (Oct 11 2019)
-  (Bayesian/Hierachical) Models to Study: Mixture Models and Matrix Factorization
    (- Hierarchical: Normal-Gamma etc.)
    (- Maybe change prior distributions)
  - Data: Exchangeable data (ex. Gaussian Mixture Models, Matrix Factorization: Netflix https://archive.org/download/nf_prize_dataset.tar    https://www.kaggle.com/netflix-inc/netflix-prize-data)
  - Inference: Use standard inference methods for corresponding model
  - Criticism: PPC, POP-PC (Against good fitting model and bad fitting model if possible)
- 1 epoch of Box's loop
  - Analyze the results of criticism.
  - If we have time, find ways to make POP-PC better
# To do
- By Sunday (Oct 13 2019) read both models and discuss on Sunday night

# Update
- Implement the folowwing:
  - Jay -> GMM
  - Yuki -> PMF
