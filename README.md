# mlpp_pop_pc
- This repository is for the Machine Learning for Probabilistic Programming Project.
- We focus on the criticism aspect of the Box's loop, and will analyze criticism frameworks such as the Posterior Predictive Check (PPC) and Population Predictive Check (POP-PC), and test them on different types of probabilistic models that were not mentioned in the original paper.
